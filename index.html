                    My research focuses on designing algorithms to optimize NLP systems. I'm particularly interested in formalizing methods for reasoning-intensive problems in language models, optimizing retrieval mechanisms for knowledge-intensive tasks, and creating mathematical frameworks that can prove properties about language model reasoning while balancing performance with computational efficiency.
