                    What is Operations Research??
                </h1>
                
                <p>
                    Operations Research (OR) is a discipline that originated at MIT during World War II, applying mathematical and analytical methods to optimize complex decision-making processes.

                <p>
                    Initially, OR focused on military logistics and resource allocation, helping plan transportation routes, supply chains, and manufacturing schedules. The field's core methodologies include mathematical optimization, simulation, queueing theory, and decision analysis.

                <p>
                    Today, Operations Research has expanded far beyond its original applications and now impacts virtually every industry:
                </p>
                
                <ul class="pl3">
                    <li>Healthcare: optimizing patient scheduling, resource allocation, and treatment planning</li>
                    <li>Transportation: designing efficient networks for airlines, railways, and urban transit</li>
                    <li>Energy: managing power grid operations and planning renewable energy integration</li>
                    <li>Finance: portfolio optimization and risk management</li>
                    <li>Telecommunications: network design and capacity planning</li>
                    <li>Computing: algorithm design and system optimization</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
		Modern OR increasingly intersects with data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, creating powerful new approaches to solving complex real-world problems.

		My initial research interests was on contextualizing the behavior and utility of machine learning models as they interplay with humans or in the design of algorithms! With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the general excitement over their integration into our day–to–day lives, the question of how to properly utilize their capabilities becomes vital. Questions like the ones below once peaked my interest and still:
                </p>
                
                <ul class="pl3">
                    <li>Which quantities should we query the model for in order to enhance performance?</li>
		    <li>How should our decisions be affected by the operational cost of those model queries?</li>
                    <li>How can our decisions be robust against the errors that the model will naturally exhibit?</li>
                </ul>
