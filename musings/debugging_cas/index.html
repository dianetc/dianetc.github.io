			<p> <b>CAS</b> stands for computer algebra system and is any software meant to manipulate mathematical expressions. Popular software of this form are <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a>, <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a>, and <a href="https://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/">Maple</a>.</p>

			<p> Debugging these types of systems can be difficult. Inputs to the same mathematical function might send you into wildly different areas of the code base (but that is not clear a priori). Especially in the case of SymPy, a very complex codebase which makes extensive use of Python's overloading capabilities.</p>

			<p> My go-to debugging strategy in this scenario is to, run both input instances simultaneously then step through each in parallel. This can be arduous and super easy to miss the diverging point. </p>

			<p> I created a small debugging aid, called <a href="https://github.com/dianetc/divergence">divergence</a>. The tool helps you figure out <i>where</i> two different inputs diverge in their respective stack traces.</p>

			<p> Simply choose which function you’re trying to test, create a testing method for it, tack on the <i>@diverge</i> decorate at the top with the corresponding two arguments and run! It’ll return whether they diverge and if so, which function they diverge at. A trivial example below:</p>
	
    <pre>
    <code>
    from divergence import diverge

    args = {"arg1": (3,5), "arg2": (0,0)}

    @diverge(args)
    def test_min(a,b):
	return min(a,b)

    test_min()
    </code>
    </pre>

    			<p> <b> A few remarks on the tool: </b> </p>			
                        <ul>
                                <li> Inputting the same arguments might garner slightly different stack traces and lead to a nonsensical diverging point.</li>
                                <li> Discrepancies in stack traces might not equate to meaningful differences in how things are working.</li>
                        </ul>
			
			<p> Divergence is very hacky, so I don't expect it to work super well, but if you have any feedback on the <i> approach </i> I took in trying to solve this problem, <a href="mailto:dtchuindjo@gmail.com">I'd love to hear it!</a> </p>
