**Comments on Kleesia: A Hacky Interpretation**
Below is Dr.Phil Metzger twitter post:

Here’s why I think alphaXiv is a bad idea. Pathological people will be able to pin comments directly on papers that researchers wrote in a highly visible public forum, forcing the researchers to take time defending their papers at a detailed level. I think it will be a big waste of their time. 

Also, some researchers (especially women) are chased by stalkers who will see the platform as another way to force themselves into their lives, and the researchers will not be able to escape because it will be a public forum that directly affects their research and reputation. Not all stalkers are visibly obvious to third parties. Scientific conferences have mechanisms to protect researchers from stalkers. Journals have editors that run a review process. alphaXiv bypasses those mechanisms.

I like to talk about science publicly through Twitter. Sometimes I have to mute people who want to convince me of wacko theories. The mute button makes that manageable, and the platform is separated from professional work just enough that it doesn’t matter if I don’t reply publicly to every pathological interaction. alphaXiv will be directly attached to my professional work so I am not sure pathological interactions can be ignored as easily. 

I think the existing channels to discuss academic papers (conferences, replying through peer reviewed journals, institutional email, and speaking to the press, plus Twitter) are adequate and have mechanisms in place to filter out the pathological stuff. I think peer review is good (though ofc not perfect).
