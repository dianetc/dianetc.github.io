			<p> Whenever I walk into a room, no one knows who I am. There’s no ”star” power here: no major accomplishments, no wowing people with my wit or intellect, and no social pull. I’m unassuming, unimposing, and I love it. While this may go against the human need for status, I’ve found that this laid-back attitude towards it has helped in sussing out who the best people to interact with are.</p>

			<p> You can tell a lot about a person by how they treat those they view as dumber than themselves. Increasingly, <a href="https://danluu.com/look-stupid/#fn:T">I’ve become more confident in asking ”stupid” questions</a> for my own sake, but previously I used it as a means to quickly form an opinion about a person. I would ask a ”stupid” question or make a ridiculous remark and gauge their reactions. In hindsight, this isn’t the healthiest way to approach building relationships (I've stopped doing it), but it does work. I used this method on many so-called altruists and found their altruism and true "care" for people only extended to unborn citizens hundreds of years into the future.</p>

			<p> Anonymity also helps in building stronger relationships. No one ever wants anything from me except to learn more about me and vice versa; <a href="https://notes.ekzhang.com/feelings/listening">this is a luxury that some people have a hard time affording</a>. I'm truly blessed to be able to build relationships unencumbered.</p>
