                <p> During the spring, I took a discrete probability course (6.7720). This was one of the most interesting mathematics courses I've ever taken, second only to the amazing reading course on dynamical systems under Adam Kanigowski. </p>

                <p> While I have no aspirations of becoming a theoretician (a life in academia has always been a non-starter), my time in the course allowed me to read a paper I had stored in my "papers to read" cache back in 2021: the Universal Law of Robustness paper by Sellke and Bubeck. To summarize: classically, models that interpolate (perfectly fit) their training data were expected to over-fit and generalize poorly. However, they often perform well in practice, a phenomenon that led to Belkin et al.'s discovery of the "double descent" curve. In this paper, Sellke proposes a necessary condition for fitting that explains the emergence of this curve.</p>

		        <p> Back in 2021, I found the paper to be a tough read. However, after taking the course, I found it rather pleasant, with well-written and concise proofs.</p>

		        <p> As a final project, I wrote an exposition on this paper. This exposition, </p>

		        <ul>
			        <li> Outlines the main ideas/intuition behind the paper. </li>
			        <li> Presents some open questions. </li>
			        <li> Gives a short description of a recent extension. </li>
		        </ul>

		        <p> If you're interested in this paper but struggle to read it and want a more hand wavy (intuition heavy) perspective on it, <a href="SP_Final_Project_blog.pdf"> read the exposition here</a>. </p>
