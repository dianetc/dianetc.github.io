		    <p> Many platforms have attempted to build communities centered around research discussions, with notable examples including ResearchGate, Academia.edu, and the recent addition of Alphaxiv. However, these platforms often struggle to create an engaging user experience that encourages regular participation; they've not yet solved the classic chicken-and-egg problem of building a critical mass of <i>active</i> users.</p>
